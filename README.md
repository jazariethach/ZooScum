##Building the Game
-----------------
Once the project is downloaded, you can build the game by using ANT commands to create the jar file and run the game with one of the following commands:
* ant run	Runs the game starting at the game's menu screen
* ant run-jar   Runs the game from the created jar file
* ant run-game	Runs the game starting at the game's first level                   

The main libraries we use are java standard libraries including but not limited to Swing, Event, and Util libraries

The Game begins with a menu screen that has the following options: New Game, How to Play, Exit

##New Game
--------
* The player can start a new game that begins at the first level by clicking the "New Game" button

##Instructions
------------
* The "How to Play" button opens up a window with the premise and rules for the game

##Exit
----
*The "Exit" button closes the game and ends the session

##How to Play
